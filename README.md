A homework demo using API to create a daily planner.

## Summary
In this assignment, JQuery was used to create HTML elements in javascript. Class attributes were added using JQuery as well. Using Moment.js, I was able to incorporate the current date and time. This was used not only to display the date and time in the headter but also the display the color for each of the time blocks. The user is able to click inside the text area and type information which can then be saved to local storage when the save button us clicked. The user input text is still displayed after refreshing due to the information being pulled from the local storage.
